<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p>To start talking to another Git repo, use “git remote add”. This gives you a short name used to refer to the other repo (called a “remote”).<br>
<br>
Use “git fetch” to fetch the branches from that remote. These are now available in your repo as “&lt;name&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;”, and you can “git log” or “git diff” these branches.<br>
<br>
To merge one of these branches into the current branch, use “git merge”.<br>
<br>
git pull is a shorthand for those two commands, but don't use it if you don't want to merge.<br>
