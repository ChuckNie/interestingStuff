<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p>Finally, to get you started with simple usage of Git, here are some basic commands.<br>
<br>
First, there are a couple of commands to make sure that your snapshots get the correct author information. You only need to run this once per machine you work on.<br>
<br>
You can always get help on specific commands. “-h” gives you a short overview, “git help” gives you the reference docs for a command.<br>
<br>
To start a new repo in the current directory, run “git init”. The current directory will be your working directory, and the objects, staging area, branches, tags, and other stuff will live in the “.git” subdirectory.<br>
