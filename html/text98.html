<h1>Eliminating Duplication</h1>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
With all of this information stored in the objects directory, you can safely delete the snapshot directory that you used as the source of this operation.<br>
<br>
If you want to reconstitute the snapshot at a later date it’s simply a matter of following the SHA1 of the root tree stored in the message file and extracting each tree and blob into their corresponding directory and file.<br>
<br>
For a single snapshot, this transformation process doesn’t get you much. You’ve basically just converted one filesystem into another and created a lot of work in the process.<br>
