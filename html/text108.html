<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">As you continue to learn Git, keep this parable in mind. Git is really very simple underneath, and it is this simplicity that makes it so flexible and powerful.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">One last thing before you run off to learn all the Git commands: remember that it is almost impossible to lose work that has been committed. Even when you delete a branch, all that’s really happened is that the pointer to that commit has been removed. All of the snapshots are still in the objects directory, you just need to dig up the commit SHA1.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">In these cases, look up “git reflog”. It contains a history of what each branch pointed to and in times of crisis, it will save the day.</p>
