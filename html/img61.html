<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p><p style="direction:ltr;">Like many software developers you have a compulsion to keep your code clean and very well organized. This carries over into a desire to keep your code history well groomed.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Last night you came home after having a few too many pints of Guinness at the local brewpub and started coding, producing a handful of snapshots along the way.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">This morning, a review of the code you wrote last night makes you cringe a little bit.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The code is good overall, but you made a lot of mistakes early on that you corrected in later snapshots.</p>
