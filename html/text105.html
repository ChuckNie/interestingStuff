<h1>Commands: Diffing</h1>
<ul><li><h2>git diff

</h2></li>
<li><h2>git diff --staged

</h2></li>
<li><h2>git diff HEAD

<li><h2>git diff &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt;</h2></li>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
To see the differences between the working directory and the staging area, use “git diff”.<br>
<br>
If you want to see the changes scheduled to become the next commit, use “git diff --staged”.<br>
<br>
“git diff HEAD” shows you the diff between the working directory and the latest commit.<br>
<br>
Finally you can use “git diff &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt;” to see the differences between any two commits in the repository.<br>
