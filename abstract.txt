The Git Parable - a different approach to understanding Git

Learning and using Git commands is all well and good, but until you have a
working understanding of how Git itself thinks and works, it will still feel
like a strange beast with lots of sharp and pointy bits.

This talk will start from scratch and introduce a mental model of how Git
works, based on very simple concepts. 

Git will still have some sharp and pointy bits, but hopefully you will be
better equipped to understand how they can work to your advantage.
